## Migrate to Azure Database for Flexible Server

### From on-premises to Flexible Server

Migration from external sources such as other cloud providers or instances running on-premises will require the movement of database artifacts and data.  There are currenctly serveral tools available to do this:

- Database tools
  - [Azure Database Migration Service (DMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dms/tutorial-postgresql-azure-postgresql-online)
  - [pg_dump and pg_restore](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/migrate/how-to-migrate-using-dump-and-restore)
- [Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/migrate/how-to-migrate-single-to-flexible-portal)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/migrate/how-to-migrate-single-to-flexible-cli)

In addition to any migration pre-requisities, you must also ensure that a network path exists between the on-premises instance/tool and the remote Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server instance.  This can be more complicated than at first glance depending on a number of different network topology possibilies.

### Offline vs Online migrations

For smaller and less used databases, the migration process is likely to be quick and effortless.  However, in larger and more heavily used environments, the choice of how you migrate will be a vital decision to ensure applications and end users are not subject to lengty downtime and productivity loss.

You can choose between the two following paths:

- **Offline Migration** â€“ In an offline migration, all applications connecting to your source instance are stopped and the database(s) is copied to flexible server.

- **Online Migration** - In an online migration, applications connecting to your source instance are not stopped while database(s) are copied to the target server. The initial copy of the databases is followed by replication to keep the target server in sync with the source server. A cutover is performed when the target server is in complete sync with the source server resulting in minimal downtime.
