## Responsible AI

It's easy to be fascinated with AI and generative AI in particular, but you need to consider how you would use it responsibly. You need to consider things like how to ensure the output is fair, non-harmful and more. This chapter aims to provide you with mentioned context, what to consider, and how to take active steps to improve your AI usage.

## Principles

The principles of Responsible AI include:

    - Fairness
    - Inclusiveness
    - Reliability/Safety
    - Security & Privacy
    - Transparency and Accountability. 

With these principles in mind, developers should consider their context with the use of Generative AI in their applications.

## Harmful Results

### Hallucinations

Hallucinations are a term used to describe when an LLM produces content that is either completely nonsensical or something we know is factually wrong based on other sources of information.

In many cases, AI can provide confident and thorough answers. Unfortunately, these answers can also be incorrect. For individuals that may be new to your application and data, AI answers can be persuasive enough to not be questioned and treated as fact. The consequences of this can lead to the AI system being unreliable and negatively impact the reputation of your users and company as a whole.

With each iteration of any given LLM, there have been several performance improvements around minimizing hallucinations. However, even with these improvements, we as application builders and users still need to remain aware of these limitations.
