## 08 / Summary

Many customers have built scalable resilient architectures using Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server. Developers can build basic two-tier and three-tier architectures to more advanced container-based and event-driven PostgreSQL-based architectures.

At the very core, an application will consume CPU, memory, disk and network. Finding the right target hosting platform while balancing costs is a vital skill. Developers should leverage the examples provided throughout this guide to accelerate their learning and adoption journey.

### Checklist

- Reference architectures can provide ideas on how to use a product. Start to learn from successful deployments.
- Utilize the valuable knowledge of others to build and design applications.
- Implement common proven patterns in architectures.
