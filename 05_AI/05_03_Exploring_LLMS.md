## Language Models

In this section we will explore the different types of LLMs that exist today along with how to test different models for various use cases in Azure. We will then show how easy it is to deploy an LLM in Azure.

### Large Languange Models (LLMs)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI model trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. LLMs are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as Transformers, and they are known for their ability to perform a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks. LLMs can be categorized based on their architecture, training data, and use case. Understanding how a model is designed will help in selecting the right model for the target scenario. It will also help with understanding how to test, iterate, and improve the model performance.

Key characteristics and capabilities of Large Language Models include:

- Scale: immense scale in terms of the number of parameters used in LLM architecture are characteristic for them. Models like GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3) contain hundreds of millions to trillions of parameters, which allow them to capture complex patterns in language.
- Pretraining: LLMs undergo pretraining on a large corpus of text data from the internet, which enables them to learn grammar, syntax, semantics, and a broad range of knowledge about language and the world.
- Fine-tuning: After pretraining, LLMs can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains with smaller, task-specific datasets. This fine-tuning process allows them to adapt to more specialized tasks, such as text classification, translation, summarization, and question-answering.

The choice of model comes down to three major areas:

    - What is the goal
    - What the data looks like
    - How much budget is available

When it comes to data, a differnt model will be required based on if it is text, audio, video, image generation and so forth.

    - **Audio** : Whisper-type models are a fantastic choice as they are general-purpose and aimed at speech recognition. Audio models are trained on diverse audio and can perform multilingual speech recognition. Learn more about Whisper type models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

    - **Images** : For image generation, DALL-E and Midjourney are two very well-known choices. DALL-E is offered by Azure OpenAI. Read more about DALL-E [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

    - **Text generation** : Most models are trained on text generation and there are a large variety of choices from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 and others. They come at different costs with the latest GPT-4 being the most expensive. Azure offers many ways to deploy and utilize models which provider ultimate flexibility in selecting the best fit for a wide array of capability and cost requirements.

Selecting a model means inheriting the basic built-in capabilities of that model, however, it may that an application or use case will need just a little bit more than the model is able to provide. In many cases, developers have company specific data that an LLM model must be integrated with. There are a few different approaches for that and we will explore them in more detail in the upcoming sections.

#### GPT

GPT stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer, and it refers to a series of large language models developed by OpenAI. The GPT models are neural networks pretrained on vast amounts of data from the internet, making them capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

Here's an overview of the major GPT models and their key characteristics:

GPT-3: GPT-3, released in June 2020, is a well-known model in the GPT series. It has 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest and most powerful language models in existence. GPT-3 achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks. It can perform tasks like text completion, translation, question-answering, and more with human-level fluency. GPT-3 is divided into various model sizes, ranging from the smallest (125M parameters) to the largest (175B parameters).

GPT-4: GPT-4, the latest GPT model from OpenAI, has 1.76 trillion parameters.

### Small Language Models (SLMs)

LLMs are typically trained on large text datasets which enable capabilities like generating text, summarizing documents, translating between languages, and answering questions.

Small language models (SLMs) fill much of the same niche but with notably smaller model sizes. A model is typically considered small when it has under 100 million parameters,  with some suggesting cutting off at even lower thresholds like 10 million or 1 million parameters. For comparison, models considered large tend to scale to over 100 billion parameters, like the aforementioned GPT-3/4 models from OpenAI.

Smaller model sizes allow the models to be more efficient, economical, and customizable than the larger counterparts. This can come with the drawback that they achieve lower overall capabilities since model capacity in language models has been shown to correlate with size.

Because of the smaller number of parameters, SLMs are significantly less computationally needy than massive models like GPT-3/4:

- Faster in inference speed and throughput since fewer parameters are needed when executing.
- Require less memory and storage space.

These efficiency advantages directly relate to cost savings of training and running the models.

### Services vs Models

The world of AI can be confusing to someone learning all the terms and history. It is important to be able to distingish beween a service and a model. A service is a product that is offered as a combination of models, data, and other components. A model is the core component of a service.

Services are often optimized for production use and tend to be easier to use than models. They may have APIs or graphical user interfaces. Services are not always available for free, and may require a subscription or payment. These payments help pay for the equipment and resources and well as the optimizing of expenses and scaling needs required to support the service.

For example, Microsoft Azure OpenAI offers pay-as-you-go plans which allow developers to be charged proportionally to how much they use the service. In addtion to access to the models and service, Azure OpenAI offers enterprise-grade security and a responsible AI framework in addition to the models' capabilities.

Models are the Neural Network, with the parameters, weights, and others needed components. If a model was to be trained and run locally, it would be necessary to buy hardware (such as GPUs), build infrastructure to scale and potentially buy a license for a closed-model or use an open-source model.

### Open vs Closed Source

Another way to categorize LLMs is whether they are open or closed source. Open source meaning the code is published for everyone to see, such as on GitHub, versus a closed source where the developer keeps and own the source code.

Open-source models are made available to the public and can be used by anyone. They are often made available by the company that created them, or by the research community. These models are allowed to be inspected, modified, and customized for the various use cases in LLMs. However, they are not always optimized for production use, and may not be as performant as proprietary models. Plus, funding for open-source models can be limited, and they may not be maintained long term or may not be updated with the latest research. Examples of popular open source models include Alpaca, Bloom and LLaMA.

Closed-source models are models that are owned by an individual and/or company and are not made available to the public. These models are often optimized for production use. However, they are not allowed to be inspected, modified, or customized for different use cases. They are not always available for free and may require a subscription or payment to use them. Additionally, users do not have control over the data that is used to train the model. This means they should entrust the model owner with ensuring commitment to data privacy and responsible use of AI (topics we explore in later sections). Examples of popular proprietary models include OpenAI models, Google Bard or Claude 2.

### LLM Outputs

LLMs can also be categorized by the output they generate.

### Embeddings

Embeddings are a concept in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) that involve representing objects, such as words, documents, or entities, as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. These vectors are often dense, meaning that they have a high number of dimensions, and they are learned through various techniques, including neural networks. Embeddings aim to capture semantic relationships and similarities between objects in a continuous vector space.

Common types of embeddings include:

- word: In NLP, word embeddings represent words as vectors. Each word is mapped to a vector in a high-dimensional space, where words with similar meanings or contexts are located closer to each other. Word2Vec and GloVe are popular word embedding techniques.
- document: These represent documents as vectors. Doc2Vec is popularly used to create document embeddings.
- image: Images can be represented as embeddings to capture visual features, allowing for tasks like object recognition.
Embeddings are central to representing complex, high-dimensional data in a form easily processable by machine learning models. They can be trained on large datasets and then used as features for various tasks, and are used by LLMs.

Embedding models are designed to convert input into a numerical form, called an embedding. Embeddings are numerical representations of the input. Embeddings make it easier for machines to understand the relationships between words or sentences and can be consumed as inputs by other models, such as classification models, or clustering models that have better performance on numerical data. Embedding models are often used for transfer learning, where a model is built for a surrogate task for which there is an abundance of data, and then the model weights (embeddings) are re-used for other downstream tasks. An example of this category is OpenAI embeddings.

PostgreSQL can gain the capabilities of [generating vector embeddings with Azure AI extension OpenAI integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/generative-ai-azure-openai).

### Text + Code

Text and code generation models are models that generate text or code. These models are often used for text summarization, translation, and question answering. Text generation models are often trained on large datasets of text, such as BookCorpus, and can be used to generate new text, or to answer questions. Code generation models, like CodeParrot, are often trained on large datasets of code, such as GitHub, and can be used to generate new code, or to fix bugs in existing code.

### Speech to Text, Text to Speech

Using LLMs to process audio to text has become very common. There are several benefits to using AI to do this:

- Improved accuracy: LLMs can improve the accuracy of speech recognition systems in noisy environments.
- Accents: LLMs are more robust to accents than traditional speech recognition systems. This is because LLMs are trained on a massive dataset of text from a variety of speakers.
- Scalability: LLMs can be scaled to handle large volumes of audio data. This makes them ideal for use in applications such as call centers and customer service.

Microsoft provides several options for using Speech to Text and vice versa through the Conginitive Services offerings as well as the model regsitries in the various AI Studios.

- [Azure Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com/)
- [Azure AI Studio models registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog)

### Image

Image generation models are models that generate images. These models are often used for image editing, image synthesis, and image translation. Image generation models are often trained on large datasets of images, such as LAION-5B, and can be used to generate new images or to edit existing images with inpainting, super-resolution, and colorization techniques. Examples include DALL-E-3 and Stable Diffusion models.

## Search

Why Search with AI? It turns out that search is core to the way we interact with models and how they work.

### Text Search

Before embedding models created vectors, search engines worked by creating indexes of content using ranking functions. The most common ranking function being Okapi BM25 (BM25).

BM25 is a bag-of-words retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each document, regardless of their proximity within the document. It is a family of scoring functions with slightly different components and parameters.

This is still a popular way of indexing documents, but let us also explore how GenAI finds information it uses in generating completions.

### Semantic Search

Semantic search is a search technique that uses the semantics, or meaning, of the words in a query to return relevant results.

Here is an example of a semantic search. Let us say you were looking to buy a car, you might search for 'my dream car', semantic search understands that you are not dreaming about a car, but rather you are looking to buy your ideal car. Semantic search understands your intention and returns relevant results. The alternative is keyword search which would literally search for dreams about cars and often returns irrelevant results.

As we have already discussed above, text embeddings are a text representation technique used in natural language processing. Text embeddings are semantic numerical representations of text. Embeddings are used to represent data in a way that is easy for a machine to understand. There are many models for building text embeddings

Building semantic search capability on custom data using GenAI and Azure Database for Flexible Server involves the following steps:

- Identify the search scenarios. Identify the data fields that will be involved in search.
- For every data field involved in search, create a corresponding vector field of type embedding.
- Generate embeddings for the data in the selected data fields and store the embeddings in the corresponding vector fields.
- Generate the embedding for any given input search query.
- Search for the vector data field and list the nearest neighbors.
- Run the results through appropriate relevance, ranking and personalization models to produce the final ranking. In the absence of such models, rank the results in decreasing dot-product order.
- Monitor the model, results quality, and business metrics such as CTR (click-through rate) and dwell time. Incorporate feedback mechanisms to debug and improve the search stack from data quality, data freshness and personalization to user experience.

### Hybrid search

Hybrid search is the combination of Semantic Search and Text Search. This typically involves adding some metadata to the stored vectors. This can allow for faster and more releveant recall in some cases.

## Vectors

A vector is a mathematical concept used in linear algebra and geometry to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. In the context of machine learning, vectors are often used to represent data points or features. Some key vector attributes and operations include:

- Dimension: The dimension of a vector is the number of elements that it contains. In the example above, vector1 and vector2 are both two-dimensional since they each have two elements. It is simple to visualize vectors with three dimensions or less, but, vectors can have many more than simply three dimensions. In fact, as explored later, vectors that encode words and text tend to have hundreds or thousands of dimensions.

- Magnitude: The magnitude of a vector is a non-negative number that represents the vector's size or length. Magnitude can also be refered to as the `norm`, and can be denoted with ||v|| or |v|. There are many different definitions of magnitude or norm, but the most common is the Euclidean norm or 2-norm.

- Unit vector: A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of one. In the example above, vector1 and vector2 are unit vectors.

- Direction: The direction of a vector specifies the line along which the vector points. Direction can be represented using angles, unit vectors, or coordinates in different coordinate systems.

- Dot product (scalar product): The dot product of two vectors, u and v, is a number given by u ⋅ v = ||u|| ||v|| cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the two vectors. Another way to compute the dot product is to do an element-wise multiplication of u and v and sum the results. The dot product is one of the most important and widely used vector operations because it measures the similarity between two vectors.

- Orthogonal vectors: Vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero, meaning that they are at a 90 degree angle to each other. Think of orthogonal vectors as being completely unrelated to each other.

- Dense vector: A vector is considered dense if most of its elements are non-zero. Words and text are most usefully represented with dense vectors because each dimension encodes meaningful information.

### Vector Similarity

Euclidean distance – The straight-line distance between points.
L1 (Manhattan) distance – The sum of the differences of all the vector components. L1 distance measures how many orthogonal city blocks required to traverse from point A to point B.
L-infinity (chessboard) distance – The number of moves a King would make on an n-dimensional chessboard. It is different than Euclidean distance on the diagonals—a diagonal step on a 2-dimensional chessboard is 1.41 Euclidean units away, but 2 L-infinity units away.
Inner product – The product of the magnitudes of two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. Usually used for natural language processing (NLP) vector similarity.
Cosine similarity – The cosine of the angle between two vectors in a vector space.
Hamming distance – For binary-coded vectors, the number of bits that differ between the two vectors.

### Cosine Similiarity

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors, this is referred to as nearest neighbor search. To perform a cosine similarity search, vectorize the query text using the OpenAI Embedding API. Then calculate the cosine similarity between the query vector and each vector in the Embedding Index. Remember, the Embedding Index has a vector for each YouTube transcript text segment. Finally, sort the results by cosine similarity and the text segments with the highest cosine similarity are the most like the query.

From a mathematic perspective, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multidimensional space. This measurement is beneficial, because if two documents are far apart by Euclidean distance because of size, they could still have a smaller angle between them and therefore higher cosine similarity. For more information about cosine similarity equations, see [Cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).

### Vector Storage

Once embeddings have been generated, they must be stored somewhere. This could be in memory locally, or in memory remotely. It could also be persisted to disk storage. We will explore several types of storage mechanisms (such as PostgreSQL) in a later section.

## Improving Results

With a firm understading of the various pre-trained models, using tools like Azure Machine Learning can enable developers to compare different models, evaluate them on test data, improve performance and deploy manually or via a service. But when should developers consider fine-tuning a model rather than using a pre-trained one? Fine-tuned models come with extra costs in terms of the hardware and time that is necessary to train them. If the costs outweigh the benefits, then what might be other approaches to improve model performance on specific workloads?

It turns out there are several approaches a business can use to get the results they need from an LLM wether it is pre-trained or fine-tuned. The most common in order of each and cheap to most difficult and expensive are:

    - Prompt Engineering
    - Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
    - Fine tuned model
    - Trained model

We will explore prompt engineering and RAG in more detail in the following sections.

### Fine tuned models

Fine-tuning is a process that leverages transfer learning to adapt the model to a downstream task or to solve a specific problem. Different from few-shot learning and RAG, it results in a new model being generated, with updated weights and biases. It requires a set of training examples consisting of a single input (the prompt) and its associated output (the completion). This would be the preferred approach if:

    - Using fine-tuned models. A business would like to use fine-tuned less capable models (like embedding models) rather than high performance models, resulting in a more cost effective and fast solution.

    - Considering latency. Latency is important for a specific use-case, so it is not possible to use very long prompts or the number of examples that should be learned from the model does not fit with the prompt length limit.

    - Staying up to date. A business has a lot of high-quality data and ground truth labels and the resources required to maintain this data up to date over time.

### Trained model

Training an LLM from scratch is without a doubt the most difficult and the most complex approach to adopt, requiring massive amounts of data, skilled resources, and appropriate computational power. This option should be considered only in a scenario where a business has a domain-specific use case and a large amount of domain-centric data.

### Deploying Language Models in Azure

[Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) is the most common and practical way to gain access to various Large Language Models.

Azure OpenAI supports several models, however due to the ever changing landscape, these models are subject to change. To see the latest models available, reference [Azure OpenAI Service models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models).
