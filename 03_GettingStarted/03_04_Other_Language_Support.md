### Other notable languages for PostgreSQL apps

#### .NET

This wouldn't be a comprehensive guide without some mention of .NET.  You can utilize the popular framework called `Npgsql` from .NET applications to make calls to Azure Database for PostgreSQL instances.

For an example, reference [Quickstart: Use .NET (C#) to connect and query data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/connect-csharp).

#### Others

Like the other language support guides, Flexible Server is compatible with all PostgreSQL clients that support PostgreSQL. Microsoft provides a curated list of compatible [connection libraries for PostgreSQL Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-connection-libraries) including: Python, PHP, Node.js, Java, Ruby, Go, C#/.NET, ODBC, C and C++.
